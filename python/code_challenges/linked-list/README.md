# Generate the nth Fibonacci number

+ **Node**
  + Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
+ **Linked List**
  + Create a Linked List class, include a head property.
  + Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

## Challenge

+ **Node**
  + Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
+ **Linked List**
  + Create a Linked List class
    + Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
  + Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
  + The class should contain the following methods:
    + *insert*
    + Arguments: value
    + Returns: nothing
    + Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance
    + *includes*
    + Arguments: value
    + Returns: Boolean
    + Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
    + *to string*
    + Arguments: none
    + Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
`"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"`

## Approach & Efficiency

+ I started by creating the Node class and defining its properties. This was simple and gave context when working with the linked list.
+ For the Linked List class I created an illustration of each function in order to clarify which inputs and outputs I was working with for each problem.
+ I then built the code for each function based on the logic I identified in their visulizations.
+ Finally, I tested functionlity and syntax in my final code.
