# Code Challenge 08 - Zip two linked lists.

### Challenge

+ **Write a function called zip_lists**
  + Arguments: 2 linked lists
  + Return: New Linked List, zipped as noted below
+ Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists
+ Return a reference to the the zipped list

### Approach & Efficiency

+ I used a whiteboard visual for this challenge.
+ I started by looking at the example diagram provided with the code challenge. I looked at how the nodes should alternate and what happened when one list ran out before the other.
+ I then thought about what that would look like in code.
+ I kept iterating through a few different ways to solve the problem until Isaiah figured out what I thought would be the simplest answer.
+ Finally, I created exceptions for values that are out of the range of our linked list.
