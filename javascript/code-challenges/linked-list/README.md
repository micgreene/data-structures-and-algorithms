# Code Challenge 05 - Linked List Implementation

- [Pull Request](https://github.com/micgreene/data-structures-and-algorithms/pull/20)

## Challenge Summary

Implementation: Singly Linked Lists

## Challenge Description

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

- Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

  - Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

  - Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.

  - Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as: `"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"`

## Approach & Efficiency

- Using the problem domain as a guide, first I identified the problems to solve.

- 

- Once I understood the basic logic, I then whiteboarded the algorithm in plain english:


- I then started to code the problem out loosely using pseudo code:

- Finally, I used my pseudo code as a guide to complete my full code.
