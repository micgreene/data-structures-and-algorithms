# Code Challenge 05 - Linked List Implementation

- [Pull Request](https://github.com/micgreene/data-structures-and-algorithms/pull/20)

## Singly Linked List

-In this challenge, we are to create a singly linked list. (meaning each node will posses a pointer to the next node (and its value) in the chain, but not the previous)

## Challenge

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

- Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
  - Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

  - Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

  - Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
    - "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

- Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

- Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).

## Approach & Efficiency

I decided to do TDD for this assignment.

- Instead of trying to figure out what the requirements were asking me to do, I instead looked through the list of tests.
  
- I wrote one testing case, attempted to implement code that passed itk, then moved on.

- When all cases were passing, I went back over to comment out and clean up my code.

## API

- *None*
